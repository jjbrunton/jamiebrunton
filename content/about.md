# Who Am I?

Hi! I'm Jamie Brunton, I'm a Software Engineer (currently a Technical Lead) focusing mostly in Azure/Cloud technologies with a strong background in C#. I spend most of my time working in the developing sector of DevOps providing clients with everything from ARM template development, all the way to full scale architectural reviews and governance.

# What Do I Do?

I've worked on some incredible projects that I'm proud of, many of which are sectors that interest me great (which I'm incredibly grateful for).

- Heathrow Airport
- GRIDSERVE
- Quartix
- Brightpearl
- NPCC (National Police Chiefs Council)
- Nottingham University

I'm always up for a challenge and immensely interested in developing my skills in PaaS/IaaS and the supporting components of these cloud based approaches.

# How Could I Help?

From consultancy, application development, cloud migration or general DevOps, I am a multi skilled engineer who is happy to lead teams to migrate small or large scale projects. If the technology or use case is interesting, I'm always willing to learn and expand my knowledge.
