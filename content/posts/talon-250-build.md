# Intro
Having already flown the bigger brother, the Mini Talon, I decided it would be nice to have a smaller, less intimidating plane to be able to launch in small spaces (parks and small fields). There's so much to choose from these days in the low weight area, so much that you end up spoiled for choice!

In the end I chose to get the Talon 250 even after having a really poor experience with the original Nano Talon - the Nano Talon has been the only model I've been unable to successfully fly before destroying it... R.I.P.

{{< figure src="/images/talon-250.jpeg" width=300 height=300 title="The ZOHD Talon 250g" >}}

The models are quite similar in design but considerably different in terms of build and durability, for example, the walls of the 250g are thin whereas the Nano Talon has a much stronger feeling fuselage.

Ultimately though, the aim of the 250g models are to provide a workable platform that tries to come in under many of the restrictions you see above the weight mentioned above. This will always end up as an exercise in compromise and this plane is no exception.

Enough about the differences, onto the plans!

# Build Plan

My plan is to use the initial PNP package to ensure I have a working setup, for this, it will be using the KOHD Lite which is a basic flight controller that has the added benefit of RTH through the use of an external GPS (cool!).

My larger models use the Eagletree Vector (http://www.eagletreesystems.com/) which is laughably expensive when compared to some of the more 'modern' flight controller solutions such as iNav (https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav). The Vector has also been discontinued as the supporting company (Eagletree Systems) are no longer in operation.

So... Where does that leave me? Well, I'd like to try and get a working plane using iNav, I've used it for a few of my quadcopter builds and I haven't had many issues that would scare me away from installing it for use on a fixed wing project.

To do that, I'm going to use the following components:

- Matek F411-WSE (http://www.mateksys.com/?portfolio=f411-wse)
  - It's probably worth mentioning that Matek are the go-to when it comes to integrated PDB/flight controllers for fixed wing. They have a great selection of boards that fit many different use cases and model sizes/weights.
- TheFPV Chaos VTX V2 (5.8GHz)
  - This one was a tricky choice. My larger models run on 1.2GHz for long range flights (still within VLOS of course!) but I have missed the ease of just rocking up to the field without the need for a ground station or large antenna.
- Foxeer Razer Micro
  - I fly Foxeer cameras on all my builds, they are cheap and cheerful.

That's the plan, but as thing goes, they always seem to change and go off in weird and wonderful tangents.. I'll update the build as it goes for anyone that may stumble across this information.

Happy flying!
