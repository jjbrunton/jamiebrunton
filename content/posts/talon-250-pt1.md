# The Maiden

The talon has so far been an absolute breeze to build and fly. Putting the model together was as simple as gluing the tail on and placing the ZOHD Kohpilot inside.


One of the things mentioned quite frequently on this model is the durability of the wing support bracket, it is a balsa wood strip with a grab nut on the underside. Suffice to say, I'll be adding to the list of people who think this part is weak, but probably not in the same scenario!

_Note: I printed the wing bracket in Eryone PETG._

On the maiden of the model, it flew fairly well, I had a few issues with the CG being slightly too far back when using the ZOHD Li-ion 2s 3500mAh pack but this was easily resolved by adding some additional weight up front. I don't think this will be too much of an issue when I put the additional FPV gear in for the longer range flying.


Honestly, I was really impressed with the Kopilot, I think this will end up being my system that I maiden my simple models with. It gives a reasonable stabiliser coupled with a return to home (supported by a BN-220 gps module). I tried the launch assist on my subsequent flights and it just _works_ which is incredibly refreshing for the hobby!

# Onwards

I'm moving onto the permanent build of the talon now, this will be using an iNav setup as previously mentioned in an earlier post. That starts with the 411-WSE being wired up to work with the talon:

I've taken this opportunity to get my R9M flashed to use ExpressLRS https://expresslrs.org. This will be used to get some family friendly range out of the little model :)

My hope is I can get everything in place within the next few days for a maiden just after this storm has subsided.
